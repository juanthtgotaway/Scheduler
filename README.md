## Description 
In this project I had to test my knowledge on what we have learned so far and how the skills and lessons we are learning can apply to real life "simple" things. Such as creating an interactive schedule that allows it to be in sync with the current time to allow you to see what you can book for your day and it will demonstrate what events you have available later in the day. This project consisted on building off what we already learned previously but adding jquery. Some things I learned throughout this project are as follows:

<br>

**ID Names matter:** At first when I was starting I had all the same IDS for the time slots and when I went to save events into the text boxes they would override each other until I understood that I needed to figure out how to only target part of the ID and not the entire ID so that the JS applied but it still kept that hour slot independent allowing it to save information under the time slot selected.

**Different but yet similar layouts** This project was very much an extension to the prior project with the Var naming. with Jquery I liked how the spelling to target items is much more condense and easier to understand. The spelling also matters and how you target IDs vs Classes seems to still be very universal.
